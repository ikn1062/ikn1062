# Hello, I'm Ishaan Narain! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
My name is Ishaan and I am a recent graduate from Northwestern University (NU) with an MS in Computer Science and a BS in Mechanical Engineering. I was born and raised in Hong Kong, and attended King George V School.

I am currently a Graduate Research Software Engineer at the Presciene Lab at Northwestern University, working on computer / operating systems related projects including database/HPC application optimization, floating point computation, and compiler construction. I am also working on a statistical reinforcement learning and control ROS2 package in C++ inspired by research in Ergodic Imitation and Koopman Operators. Previously, I have also acted as a Software Engineering Intern at Tesla with the Electrical Systems team working on developing testing frameworks in Python and debugging firmware issues in C, as well as a Technical Program Manager Intern at Tesla scaling manufacturing lines with the Battery Team.

I am currently looking for full-time opportunities in Software Engineering, Quant, and Robotics starting in Winter 2024.
