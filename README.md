# Hello, I'm Ishaan Narain! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
My name is Ishaan and I am a student at Northwestern University (NU) pursuing an accelerated MS in Computer Science, having just graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering in June 2022. (Fun fact: I was born and brought up in Hong Kong).

I am currently a Software Engineering Intern at Tesla with the Electrical Systems team, working on testing and debugging frameworks, as well as writing firmware in C and C++. Moreover, I am currently working with the Northwestern University Center for Deep Learning as a Machine Learning and MLOps Research Developer, contributing to [DELOS](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research/deep-learning/projects/delos/). Previously, I have also acted as a Technical Program Manager Intern at Tesla with the Battery Manufacturing Team, Graduate Robotics Researcher position at Northwestern University Center for Robotics, and Machine Learning Engineering Intern at [InfernoGuard](https://www.infernoguardusa.com) (NU Garage Startup).

I am currently looking for full-time opportunities in Software Engineering, Quantitative Trading, Machine Learning Engineering, and Robotics starting in Summer/Fall 2023.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I have worked on in my own time and as part of my time at Northwestern University.



### Main Projects
- [Zoom (and Live) Video Speaker Data Analysis](https://github.com/ikn1062/video_analysis)
  - Developed Zoom and Live (OWL) video data collection and analysis app, leveraging OpenCV, Mediapipe, and face recognition Python Libraries
  - Utilized 30 face-mesh tracking points to analyze speaker facial cues to predict the speaker when masks are worn
  - Launched web app on Heroku for researchers to visualize video data from MySQL utilizing Python Flask and JavaScript
  - Reduced processing time by 82% using multithreading and multiprocessing functions, executing code in NU Linux computing cluster
  - Utilized: Python (OpenCV, Mediapipe, Face recognition (dlib), pytesseract, Scikit-learn, Flask), Bash, MySQL, Javascript, NodeJS, Linux


- [Venmo Request Scheduler](https://github.com/mikeluvin/venmo-scheduler) (NU WildHacks 2022 Winner)
  -  Launched full-stack Venmo recurring payments scheduler web app on team of 4 in 24 hours, winning NU22 Hackathon prize
  -  Created 20 unique API endpoints and logic on Flask server for back-end and front-end integration, recurring payments, and messaging process
  -  anually overrode class methods from Python Venmo API wrapper to repurpose for app login and 2-factor OTP authentication

- [Northwestern University Solar Car Team - Previous Project Manager and Lead Mechanical Engineer](https://nusolar.org)
  - Managed team of 40 to design, manufacture, and assemble road-legal carbon-fiber solar vehicle to compete at Formula Sun Grand Prix
  - Engineered new suspension and monocoque chassis, increasing total power-to-weight ratio by 13% by using mechanical calculations and Matlab Simulink
  -  Led team to design and build new powertrain of car integrating battery pack, battery management system, solar array, and motor, improving solar power generated by 8%, power to weight ratio by 13%, and accomplishing an indefinite range of vehicle at 30mph
  -  Coordinated with University administration, faculty, and sponsors to secure funding and material resources over $60,000 of value
  -  Generated 40-page report detailing and analyzing the performance of vehicle systems proving compliance with 300 racing regulations
  - Refined driver and vehicle control communications by integrating 8 vehicle components using CAN protocol in embedded C++
