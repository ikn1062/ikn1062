# Hello, I'm Ishaan Narain! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
My name is Ishaan and I am a student at Northwestern University (NU) pursuing an accelerated MS in Computer Science, having just graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering in June 2022. (Fun fact: I was born and brought up in Hong Kong).

I am currently a Software Engineering Intern at Tesla with the Electrical Systems team, working on testing and debugging frameworks, as well as writing firmware in C and C++. Moreover, I am currently working with the Northwestern University Center for Deep Learning as a Machine Learning and MLOps Research Developer, contributing to [DELOS](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research/deep-learning/projects/delos/). Previously, I have also acted as a Technical Program Manager Intern at Tesla with the Battery Manufacturing Team, Graduate Robotics Researcher position at Northwestern University Center for Robotics, and Machine Learning Engineering Intern at [InfernoGuard](https://www.infernoguardusa.com) (NU Garage Startup).

I am currently looking for full-time opportunities in Software Engineering, Quantitative Trading, Machine Learning Engineering, and Robotics starting in Summer/Fall 2023.
