# Hello, I'm Ishaan Narain! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
My name is Ishaan and I am a student at Northwestern University (NU) pursuing an accelerated MS in Computer Science, having just graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering in June 2022. I was born and raised in Hong Kong, and attended King George V School.

I am currently working on research projects with the Robotics Department in Inverse Reinforcement learning for Swarm Robotics, Applied Mathematics Department in Analyzing Video Data, and am beginning to work on Core Operating Systems Projects in Parallelism. Previously, I have also acted as a Software Engineering Intern at Tesla with the Electrical Systems team working on developing testing frameworks and debugging firmware issues in Python / C++, as well as a Technical Program Manager Intern at Tesla scaling manufacturing lines with the Battery Team. I have also previously worked as a Data Science / MLOps Researcher with the [DELOS](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research/deep-learning/projects/delos/) team and a Machine Learning Engineering Intern at [InfernoGuard](https://www.infernoguardusa.com) (NU Garage Startup).

I am currently looking for full-time opportunities in Software Engineering, Quant, and Robotics starting in Summer/Fall 2023.
